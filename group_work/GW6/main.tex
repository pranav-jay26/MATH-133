    \begin{abstract}
      In this assignment, we will explore the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to predict whether or not a shot is a goal or not a goal from the 
      womenShots dataset.

    \section{Data Analysis}
    K-Nearest Neighbors is a non-parametric, supervised learning algorithm that uses the euclidean distance of a given point from other points 
    in a dataset to classify or make predictions. We will use this to predict whether a shot from a given position on the court is a goal or no goal. 
    \vspace{0.1in}
    \subsection{The Null Model}
    To establish a baseline, we will construct a model that predicts that all shots will result in no goal.
